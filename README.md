# stock_tracker

Flutter app to track stocks for multiple users, using Cloud Firestore on the backend.


## Overview

I wrote this Flutter application as a means to learn [Flutter](http://flutter.io), [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

The entire application is about 1200 lines of code, including comments. The same code base for this app (with no changes) runs as a native app on iOS and Android.


### Application Features:

▪ Support multiple users.  
▪ Create authenticated user accounts on a remote server.  
▪ When logged in, view stats for stocks you’ve selected.  
▪ Add/delete stocks.  
▪ Keep the backend and mobile application data synced.  
▪ Support offline mode.  
▪ Call remote APIs.  
▪ Serialize and deserialize JSON.
